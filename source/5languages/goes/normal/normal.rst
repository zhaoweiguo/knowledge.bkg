Code organization::

    Go programmers typically keep all their Go code in a single workspace.
    A workspace contains many version control repositories (managed by Git, for example).
    Each repository contains one or more packages.
    Each package consists of one or more Go source files in a single directory.
    The path to a package's directory determines its import path.
